pytest-random
=============

randomize your py.test run

The randomization algorithm is not the least bit sophisticated, so do not depend on this plugin for a specific degree of randomness. Please use the `--verbose` option to see the randomization for yourself.

example usage:

```bash
py.test . --random
```

options:

* `--random`            randomize the tests to be run. defaults to False.
* `--random-group`      group by fixtures to avoid multiple setUp/tearDown
                        calls. defaults to False.
* `--random-seed=RANDOM_SEED`
                        the seed to use for randomization if you need to
                        repeat a run.
* `--random-last`       use the seed from the previous run. this makes it
                        easier to track down isolation issues.
